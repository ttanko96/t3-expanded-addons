"""Tekken 2 Content's Stages, Remake: a Tekken 2 stage drawn by the Tekken 3
arcade-stage engine (the Expanded's src/tekken3_arcade_stages.c and the
add-on's src/tekken2/tmst_tekken2_stages.c).

    python tools/t2_remake_stage.py --owner bruce --pictures DIR --out DIR [--tekken3 tekken3.zip]

The old fork's tools/t2_arcade_stage.py (the user's, the version its stage
zips were made by), ported to the add-on: its stage data from the add-on's
disc reader (tools/t2_remake_disc.py), the Expanded's own
tools/arcade_stages (decode, pack, scene), the recipes in
tools/data/t2_remake_stages.json, the pictures where the caller says
(PICTURES). The rest as it was; what follows is its own description.

The stage as if Tekken 3 had it (tools/data/t2_stages.json "arcade"): an
arcade pack (tools/arcade_stages/pack.py, format pack.FORMAT) for the
owner's arena, which src/tekken3_ttt1_stage.c hands to the arcade engine
(mods/ttt1/arcade-<owner>.ast; the music stays the Tekken 2 fighter's, and
without the Arcade Stages feature the stage of tools/t2_stage.py is drawn).

- the far background: Tekken 3's strip of 64 x 64 cells round the fight, of
  16 colours each, from the stage's panorama: a picture of the player's own
  ("panorama": a file in tools/data/t2_hd or workspace/t2-import/hd, hd(), its ends faded into each
  other over "seam" pixels) or Tekken 2's (its 64 x 32 cells, each with its
  own palette, twice as tall: Tekken 2 drew them at 240 lines, Tekken 3's
  arcade draws 480); "degrees" of the turn per picture, "yoff", "pitch";
  "crop" cuts the player's picture, "erase" takes off of it what the stage
  builds in 3D (erase());
- the floor: Tekken 3's grid, fog and tables (the base arcade stage's,
  "base"), its 10 x 10 cells Tekken 2's 10 x 10 floor tiles with their own
  palettes (turned as Tekken 2 turns them), the near-camera halves each a
  quarter of its tile, magnified twice; "floor_tufts" draws dry grass on
  some of them;
- the tiles ("scenery"): the stage's own landscape, built here (rim(),
  butte(), boulder(), mushroom() and its "stacks", tufts()), textured with "materials" cut from the panorama
  picture (material(): strips of rock whose pictures run on into each
  other) and lit at their corners by a low sun and the sky;
- "grass": dry tufts round the fight, as objects (grass_sections());
- "dust": puffs the runtime raises where a fighter hits the ground (DUST);
- "eagle": four models and its perches on the buttes' tops (OBJS, ROTT,
  OBJA 200, EAGL): the runtime flies it round the canyon and lands it;
- "ship" (OBJA 202, SHIP), "gulls" (OBJA 203, GULL): a ship passing on the
  bay, gulls circling over the beach;
- "blocks", "rubble", "gears", "phone_box": London's ruins in the sand.
- "crates", "barrels", "spools", "cones", "beacons", "steams": the launch pad's
  hangar floor; the beacons' lamps turn, their light sweeps the floor, steam
  rises (ANIM: beacon_frames()); "drones" fly round as the gulls do.
- "night": no panorama, a black room (Mirror Darkness); "mirror" (MIRR): its
  mirror round the camera as tools/ttt1_stage.py mirror() (drawn by
  src/tekken3_ttt1_stage.c), its frame and the glow at its foot; "fogs":
  sheets of mist drifting low round the fight (ANIM: fog_frames());
  "feathers" (FTHR): white feathers floating down round the fight, rocking
  and turning over (drawn by src/tekken3_arcade_stages.c feathers()).
- the beach: "sea" (sea_frames(), flame_frames(): one ANIM of the panorama's
  sea row and the torches' flame), "lifeguard" (its tower), "tikis",
  "coconuts", "driftwood", "surfboard", "life_ring", "bits" (shells and
  starfish); "gulls" "crabs" (GULL: crabs on the sand after the birds).
- the Korean temple: "seokdeungs" (stone lanterns, their windows the lamp
  picture's flicker), "lotus_lines" (lotus lanterns on ropes),
  "jangseungs" (guardian posts), "cairns", "seoktap" (a stone pagoda),
  "onggis" (earthenware jars); "magpies" fly as the gulls do.
- the Taj Mahal: "pool" (pool_frames(), mughal_frames(): one ANIM of the
  panorama's water row, its reflection rippling and the moon glittering on
  it, and the lamps' flicker), "mughal_lamps" (brass lamps on posts),
  "diya_lines" (oil lamps on the ground), "cypresses" (in marble pots),
  "jalis" (pierced marble screens), "kalashas" (brass pots with marigolds),
  "fountains" (lotus basins, their spray); "bats" fly as the gulls do,
  fluttering; "fireflies" (FFLY) glow and fade low round the fight.
- Szechwan Fields: "clouds" (cloud_frames(), szechwan_frames(),
  smoke_frames(): one ANIM of the panorama's cloud row billowing, the
  prayer flags fluttering and the incense smoke rising), "sky" (the
  picture's sky lengthened up to that blue), "bamboos" (living clumps),
  "tea_rows" (clipped hedges), "pailou" (a painted gate), "censer" (a
  bronze ding, its smoke), "flag_lines" (prayer flags), "wine_jars",
  "sheaves", "baskets", "mossy_stones"; "cranes" fly as the gulls do, in
  a V; "fireflies" "kind" "butterfly" (FFLY): butterflies by day.
- Morning Fields: "clouds" as Szechwan's (the flags' red a scarecrow's rag),
  "grade" a morning haze on the horizon, "bales" (round hay bales),
  "walls" (dry-stone), "rail_fences" (with a gate), "cross" (a wayside
  cross), "cart" (a hay cart), "scarecrow", "skeps" (beehives on a bench),
  "sunflowers", "flowers" (wild flower clumps, as the tufts); "doves" fly
  as the gulls do, "rabbits" hop round the fight after them (GULL kind 1),
  "feathers" "petal" white: dandelion fluff.
- Serene Forest: "wrap" (one turn of a picture that repeats, its start
  crossfaded from past its end), "foot" (the trunks going into the dark
  under them), "grass" with ferns round the fighters, "forest"
  (forest_pictures(): the bugs' glow, the fern); built but left out for
  now: "seam_repeat", "clouds" "extras" false (a row swaying alone in the
  ANIM), sun_pulse() (ANI4: "sun_patches"' light and beams brightening
  and fading), "fogs" as ANI2, "logs", "stumps", "mushrooms";
  "fireflies" "kind" "bugs" (FFLY kind 2: glowing bugs of four colours),
  "feathers" "leaves" (FTHR shape 4: autumn leaves strewn, kicked up, one
  or two falling from the trees).
- the Great Wall: "squeeze" (the sky pressed down: its thin clouds over the
  hills, where the camera sees them), "clouds" "picture" "great-wall"
  (great_wall_frames(): war banners, the beacon's fire, a dragonfly, a puff
  of dust in the flags' place; smoke_frames() "plume"), "battlements" (the
  parapet in ruins), "rubble_bricks", "beacon_towers" (fire and smoke on
  top), "war_banners"; "crows" fly in a flock; "fireflies" "kind"
  "dragonfly" (FFLY kind 3: hovering and darting), "feathers" "dust" (FTHR
  shape 5: wisps the wind drives along the ground).

Game data and pictures made from it stay in workspace/: written to
workspace/t2-import/stages/arcade-<owner>.ast and copied into the staged
catalogue and each build's mods/ttt1.

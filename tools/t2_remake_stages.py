"""Tekken 2 Content's Stages, Remake: the 23 packs of
addons/tmst/workspace/t2-stages/remake/stageNN.ast (as the Classic's
classic/: NN Tekken 2's stage; the runtime, src/tekken2/tmst_tekken2_stages.c,
draws them when GAME OPTION's TEKKEN 2 STAGES says REMAKE).

    python tools/t2_remake_stages.py [--disc <Tekken 2 disc>] [--tekken3 <tekken3.zip>] [--stage N ...]

- the stages with a Remake (tools/data/t2_remake_stages.json "arcade"; the
  old fork's recipes, tools/t2_remake_stage.py builds them): from the
  Tekken 2 disc and tekken3.zip (the Tekken 3 arcade stage a recipe takes its
  floor and its pictures from); the panorama the user's background
  (users_picture(), from the patches tools/t2_remake_patch.py opens with the
  disc), else Tekken 2's own (classic_picture()), in the Classic's frame
  (t2_remake_stage.classic_cfg(): as high on the floor as the Classic); the
  high half's pictures never on Unknown's wolf nor TTT Hitspark's fixed
  cells (RESERVED); the wolf's area taken only when a pack does not fit
  without it; for the stages of "wolf_cut" two packs: stageNNw.ast, drawn
  while Unknown fights, whose background loses as few top cell rows as it
  takes instead (cut_fitted()), and stageNN.ast with all of it (full_fitted(),
  the wolf's area too; wolf_name(); the user's, 2026-11-08), one alone when
  the whole does not fit;
- Cambodian Wetlands, Athens, Nowhere Desert, Hills and Eternal Darkness
  (the old fork's last five, 2026-11-07: "own_frame") in the old fork's own
  frame, the recipe as it is (no Classic frame: Eternal Darkness has no
  panorama of Tekken 2's, and the Classic frame's eight cell rows would not
  fit), the user's picture from its patch; their animations' frames past
  the VRAM (T2AN) as the others';
- every stage without tekken3.zip, and one of the five whose picture the
  patch did not give: the Classic's pack as it is.

Sections: the engine's (VRAM, TILE, FARB, FLOR, TRIG, ANIM), the old fork's
that the Expanded's engine does not read (DUST, GULL, FTHR, ...: the
add-on's runtime, later phases), its objects under the add-on's names (OBJS
T2OB, ROTT T2RT, OBJA T2OA: the engine's T3 path would take them as Tekken
3's stage 3 or 11 objects, and turns a pack of more than 4 models away), and
the add-on's own as the Classic's (T2FX the fighters' light, T2MR Mirror
Darkness's mirror). Nothing of the disc goes into git.

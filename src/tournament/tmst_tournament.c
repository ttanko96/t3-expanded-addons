/* tmst.tournament: the King of Iron Fist Tournament, a mode of its own.
 *
 * TOURNAMENT MODE, the main menu's row under TEKKEN FORCE MODE
 * (src/core/tmst_menu.c), opens the Team Battle grid: the team size prompt is
 * answered for the player (1 against 1), and the grid's lower part shows the
 * five tournaments (src/tournament/tmst_tournament_pools.c): up / down choose,
 * CROSS takes an open one, CIRCLE leaves to the menu. Then the grid is the
 * tournament's: the fighters outside its pool, and its final boss, are grey
 * and refused as the grid refuses a fighter already in the team (the player
 * block's availability mask, ANDed at every pad read, on whichever page L2 /
 * R2 show), and the confirm buttons are swallowed on them; SELECT goes back to
 * the list. The fighter chosen, the bracket is drawn (src/tournament/
 * tmst_bracket.c): 16 fighters, the boss apart.
 *
 * The matches. Each is the Team Battle's 1 against 1, the CPU's member the
 * player's opponent in the bracket: written as the game hands the member to
 * the fighters (0x8004F0E4, chained), the CPU's team size held at 0 until the
 * fight so the Expanded's team draw leaves it alone. Its AI level rises with
 * the round (0x800AE211, within the menu's difficulty); the rounds to win
 * (two, the bosses their own: match_rounds) are written where the Arcade
 * puts GAME OPTION's; each round full life for both. A boss with a second
 * form is a CPU team of two (Kazuya, then Devil). The fight's HUD reads
 * TOURNAMENT MODE, its opening words the tournament's name, its team figures
 * are the Arcade's round lamps. The TEAM BATTLE RESULTS tell who won (never
 * shown: covered, skipped, their music silent); the way back to the grid is
 * driven under the tournament's screens (src/tournament/
 * tmst_tournament_screens.c: the bracket, the next match, CHAMPION or
 * TOURNAMENT OVER), the next fight starting on the player's CROSS.
 *
 * With Unified Character Select on (tmst_unified_select_active), its grid
 * gets the same rule through tmst_unified_select_set_allowed.
 *
 * Progress: tournament.txt beside the memory card
 * (src/tournament/tmst_tournament_progress.c). */

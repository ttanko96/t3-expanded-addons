/* tmst.tournament: the boss intros, a short cinematic before a boss's second
 * form (Kazuya, then Devil: the user's request, 2026-11-07). It plays in the
 * Expanded's cinematic engine (src/tekken3_cine.c, a .cine file); this file
 * writes that file, so it builds and is tested alone.
 *
 * Each boss has an entry: the parts it plays one after another (clips of
 * TTT1 combat packs: its own, or another fighter's of the same body, as the
 * player's install holds them in mods/ttt1; each from a frame of its clip,
 * at a speed, blended into from the last), the character it starts as and
 * the frame it becomes the boss (the engine's `swap`), a white flash round
 * that frame, the lightning aura, where it stands, the camera's keys and the
 * fades. The parts' own sounds (their records' sound lists) are cues the
 * game side plays from the fighters' TTT1 sound packs. Nothing is taken from
 * elsewhere. A boss without an entry gets the fallback: its stance, the
 * camera coming closer. The player's fighter is hidden. */

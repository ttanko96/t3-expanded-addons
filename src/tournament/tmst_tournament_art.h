/* tmst.tournament: the pictures of its screens, put together on the CPU.
 *
 * One canvas of 854 x 480 square pixels, the 16:9 screen (its middle 640 the
 * 4:3 one), shown over the game by the core's overlay (tmst_overlay.h). On
 * it: a background (addons/tmst/data/tournament/<name>.png, any size, made
 * to fit; the player may draw their own), the fighters' faces, lines, and
 * text in Tekken 3's title font.
 *
 * The game's things are measured in its screen units (368 across the 4:3
 * screen); on the canvas a unit is ART_UNIT_NUM / ART_UNIT_DEN pixels wide
 * and one pixel tall, as the player sees them.
 *
 * What comes from the game, read while it is in VRAM, never shipped:
 *   - the title font (the selector's: 1..9, A..Z, !; no 0), from the grid;
 *   - the stock fighters' grid icons (32 x 58), from the grid's own drawing;
 *   - the guests' icon and VS portrait (126 x 252), from their
 *     mods/ttt1/<Key>-T3-ui.jui (Panda's and Tiger's too);
 *   - the stock fighters' VS portraits, from the loading screen's drawing,
 *     kept in addons/tmst/workspace/tournament/portraits/<key>.png for the
 *     next time (until then their icon stands in). */

/* tmst.tournament: the screens drawn on the art canvas (tmst_tournament_art.h).
 *
 * TOURNAMENT PROGRESS: the bracket as a pyramid, the 16 fighters along the
 * bottom, each winner one row up, the final boss at the top; winners' lines
 * gold, the losers grey where they fell; the next match marked, a strip at
 * the bottom with it and the buttons. The same pyramid,
 * finished, is TOURNAMENT OVER's, the player's line red where it broke.
 * The match view (the loading screen): both VS portraits, the round. The
 * CHAMPION: the player's portrait, the boss beaten, what is unlocked.
 *
 * Fighters are the caller's roster indices; their faces and names come
 * through ScreenRoster. */

/* TMST core: our own drawing over the game's picture, in both renderers and
 * without touching them.
 *
 * Each frame the core links a chain of packets of its own at the end of the
 * frame's display list (drawn last, so on top):
 *   - the mod's native primitives, if it set a builder (tmst_overlay_set_prims):
 *     rectangles, polygons, the game's own font from its VRAM;
 *   - the picture: an ARGB picture of the mod's, uploaded into the upper VRAM
 *     half and drawn 1:1 (sprites) or scaled onto a screen rectangle (textured
 *     quads: a picture with more texels than the rectangle has pixels is sharp
 *     where the renderer draws at a higher resolution, the OpenGL one).
 * One picture at a time, up to TMST_OVERLAY_MAX_W x TMST_OVERLAY_MAX_H, in
 * the game's screen coordinates (368 x 480 in fights and on the selectors).
 * Alpha below 128 is see-through, 128..254 half see-through (the GPU's
 * B/2 + F/2), 255 opaque.
 *
 * Several mods may draw (each on its own screens: the Jukebox on the
 * selectors, Photo Mode in fights): the picture is whoever showed it last,
 * and every mod's builder and visitor runs while a picture is shown, so each
 * returns at once while its mod shows nothing. Every drawing mod calls
 * tmst_overlay_vblank() from its VBlank plugin; more than one call per
 * VBlank only makes the half-second refresh come sooner. */

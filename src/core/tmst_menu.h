/* TMST core: rows of our own in Tekken 3's main menu: at the end of the list
 * (after every row the game has and every row the Expanded adds, its QUIT
 * GAME, now or in a later release), or right after a native row.
 *
 * The native menu reads a working list (count at +4, rows of 8 bytes from
 * +16: the label's address, then the mode byte and its flags). The Expanded
 * relocates that list and patches the menu's LUI/ORI (0x800DB5D0/D8) to its
 * copy; we read the list's address from those two instructions, so we never
 * need the Expanded's variables. The Expanded's menu code runs in its wrapper
 * of 0x80028CD4; ours is chained in front of it: our rows are taken out
 * before it runs (it always sees its own list, the highlight counted in it)
 * and put back after it, for the native menu that runs next. */
